# open-for-discourse
We are open for discourse! Imagining and creating public spaces, for public use, by public means.

An initial iteration of this project is underway in Brown 307. We are attempting to transform this space into a venue for discourse through spatial and design interventions. Using pink tape we have demarcated areas of conversation, inviting all to participate. We are posing questions on paper and on a whiteboard in order to initiate dialogue. Additionally, We have connected a Raspberry Pi to the TV in 307 in an attempt to create a public display board. Right now, there is an open [are.na channel](https://www.are.na/open-for-discourse/mica-gd-open-discourse-1518547783), which will soon be updating content in real time. 

Eventually, we hope to transition away from are.na and develop our own platform for content display. To this end, we will convert the Raspberry Pi into a server hosting this application. 

In tandem, we seek to explore ways of making 307 a more humane and user friendly space. This includes reconfiguring furniture, adding shelving, creating a free library and stocking tea/other comfort items.

This project can also be seen as a trail space for ideas relating to library wayfinding/community engagement.
